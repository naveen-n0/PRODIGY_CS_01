PRODIGY_CS_01 — Caesar Cipher GUI 🔐

This project is developed as part of my Prodigy InfoTech – Cyber Security Internship (Task 01).

It demonstrates encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm with a simple and user-friendly Python Tkinter GUI.

🚀 Features

Encrypts and decrypts text using Caesar Cipher

Simple and clean Tkinter-based GUI

Supports uppercase and lowercase letters

Safely handles spaces, numbers, and special characters

Displays output instantly

Shows error alerts for invalid shift values

🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known cryptographic techniques.
Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions.

Example (Shift = 3):

HELLO → KHOOR


Decryption reverses the shift:

KHOOR → HELLO


This project demonstrates this concept interactively using Python.
