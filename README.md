# **PRODIGY_CS_01 — Caesar Cipher GUI 🔐**

This project is developed as part of my **Prodigy InfoTech – Cyber Security Internship (Task 01)**.

It demonstrates **encryption and decryption** using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm** through a simple and user-friendly **Python Tkinter GUI**.

---

## **🚀 Features**

* Encrypts and decrypts messages using Caesar Cipher
* Simple and clean user interface
* Supports both uppercase and lowercase alphabets
* Handles spaces, numbers, and special characters safely
* Provides error alerts for invalid inputs

## **🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?**

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the earliest encryption techniques in cryptography.

It shifts each letter by a fixed number:

Example (Shift = 3):

```
HELLO → KHOOR
KHOOR → HELLO
```
